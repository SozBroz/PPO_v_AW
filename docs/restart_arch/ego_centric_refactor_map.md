# Ego-centric encoder — refactor map (spec + status)

**Scope:** STD ranked play, no fog. **Non-goal:** changing engine `GameState` seat semantics (`active_player`, `units[0/1]`, `funds[0/1]`, …). Only the **observation** tensor (and any tooling that assumes fixed P0-blocks) is remapped to **me / enemy** relative to a caller-supplied `observer` (the learner or BC “human seat”).

**Prerequisite:** [MASTERPLAN.md](../../MASTERPLAN.md) §9 (Tier 4) and the §9.1 / training-doctrine table: ego-centric encoding is the gate for seat-balanced PPO and for BC on both seats from one human game.

**Related bundle:** [`.cursor/plans/superhuman_restart_architecture_bundle.plan.md`](../../.cursor/plans/superhuman_restart_architecture_bundle.plan.md) (`ego-centric-encoder`).

### Implementation status (2026-04)

- **Shipped:** ego-centric framing and the **70-channel** spatial encoder in [`rl/encoder.py`](../../rl/encoder.py) (`N_SPATIAL_CHANNELS = 70`, `N_SCALARS = 17`). The two blocks after the pre-influence stack are **six influence planes** (indices 63–68) and **one defense-stars** plane (index 69); see module docstring and `N_INFLUENCE_CHANNEL_BASE` / `N_DEFENSE_STARS_CHANNEL`.
- **Frozen baseline (byte-identical harness):** [`tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz`](../../tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz). **Regeneration policy** (env var, review expectations, 8-sample corpus): [`tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_README.md`](../../tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_README.md). [`tests/test_encoder_equivalence.py`](../../tests/test_encoder_equivalence.py) compares live `encode_state` output to that file.

| Repo truth (2026-04) | Value |
|----------------------|--------|
| `N_SPATIAL_CHANNELS` | **70** (includes **6** influence + **1** defense_stars at the tail) |
| `N_SCALARS` | **17** |
| Encoder equivalence fixture | `tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz` |
| Regeneration / ops | `tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_README.md` |

## 1. Encoder API: before / after

### Current (fixed P0 / P1 blocks)

Implementation: [`rl/encoder.py`](../../rl/encoder.py). `N_SPATIAL_CHANNELS = 70`, `N_SCALARS = 17`. The **70** includes the **influence** block (6 channels) and **defense_stars** (1 channel) after terrain, property, capture, and neutral-income planes—see **Implementation status** above.

**Spatial (conceptual; indices are stable channel *positions*; shipped encoder uses me/enemy via `observer`):**

- **Unit presence:** `spatial[..., 0:14]` = **me** by type; `spatial[..., 14:28]` = **enemy** (`player_ch_offset = 14 * slot` with me=0, enemy=1 relative to `observer`; legacy prose below used P0/P1 when `observer=0`).
- **HP belief:** `hp_lo_ch = 28`, `hp_hi_ch = 29` — **already observer-aware:** when `belief` is set, the encoder uses exact HP for `unit.player == observer` and belief interval for the opponent (lines 292–312). When `belief is None` (STD legacy/debug), all units get exact `hp/100` in both channels (see module docstring lines 28–42).
- **Terrain:** 15 one-hot channels (offset after units + HP).
- **Property ownership:** for each property type, three slots `neutral / P0 / P1` at `prop_ch_offset + ptype*3 + ownership` with `ownership ∈ {0,1,2}` (lines 261–268).
- **Capture progress:** `cap_ch0` / `cap_ch1` = unit on tile with `player == 0` or `1` reducing `capture_points` (lines 242–280).
- **Neutral income mask:** one channel after capture pair (line 244).
- **Influence + defense stars (tail of the 70):** six influence planes (`engine/threat.py` / `compute_influence_planes`) then one map-static defense-stars channel (`TerrainInfo.defense / 4`), indices **63–69** (`N_INFLUENCE_CHANNEL_BASE` … `N_DEFENSE_STARS_CHANNEL`).

**Scalars (index → meaning today):**

| Index | Current meaning |
|------:|-----------------|
| 0 | `funds[0] / 50_000` |
| 1 | `funds[1] / 50_000` |
| 2 | P0 power bar / SCOP threshold |
| 3 | P1 power bar / SCOP threshold |
| 4 | P0 COP active |
| 5 | P0 SCOP active |
| 6 | P1 COP active |
| 7 | P1 SCOP active |
| 8 | `turn / max_turns` |
| 9 | `float(state.active_player)` **raw 0/1 (not “my turn”)** |
| 10 | `co0.co_id / 30` |
| 11 | `co1.co_id / 30` |
| 12 | tier normalized |
| 13 | rain |
| 14 | snow |
| 15 | `co_weather_segments_remaining / 2` |
| 16 | `_p0_income_share(state)` — **P0-only** share of contestable income tiles (lines 374–380) |

```python
def encode_state(state, *, observer=0, belief=None, out_spatial=None, out_scalars=None) -> (spatial, scalars):
    # spatial[..., 0:14] = P0 unit presence; [14:28] = P1 unit presence
    # property: +1 = owned by P0, +2 = owned by P1
    # cap_ch0 = P0 capturing; cap_ch1 = P1 capturing
    # scalars[0/1] = P0/P1 funds; [9] = raw active_player; [16] = p0 income share
```

### Proposed (ego-centric, same shapes)

`observer ∈ {0,1}` = engine seat of **“me”** (the policy being trained, the human in BC, or the player whose MCTS node is being evaluated). **Enemy** = `1 - observer` throughout the encoder.

- **Unit presence:** `spatial[..., 0:14]` = **me** units; `spatial[..., 14:28]` = **enemy** units.
- **Property:** `+1` = owned by me, `+2` = owned by enemy (still `0` = neutral).
- **Capture progress:** `cap_me` / `cap_enemy` (same two channel *slots* as today; rename semantics only).
- **HP:** unchanged *logic* — still exact HP for `unit.player == observer`, belief (or exact if `belief is None`) for the other side. Ego unit blocks now line up with “me” / “enemy” channel blocks.

**Scalars — full proposed layout (still `N_SCALARS = 17`):**

| Index | Ego-centric meaning |
|------:|---------------------|
| 0 | `funds[observer] / 50_000` (**me** funds) |
| 1 | `funds[1-observer] / 50_000` (**enemy** funds) |
| 2 | **me** power bar / threshold |
| 3 | **enemy** power bar / threshold |
| 4 | **me** COP active |
| 5 | **me** SCOP active |
| 6 | **enemy** COP active |
| 7 | **enemy** SCOP active |
| 8 | `turn / max_turns` (unchanged) |
| 9 | **`1.0` if `state.active_player == observer` else `0.0`** (my turn — **replaces** raw `active_player` at index 9) |
| 10 | `co_states[observer].co_id / 30` |
| 11 | `co_states[1-observer].co_id / 30` |
| 12 | tier (unchanged) |
| 13–15 | weather scalars (unchanged; not seat-tied) |
| 16 | **me income share** — `count_income_properties(observer) / n_income_tiles` (same formula as today’s P0 share but with `observer` instead of `0`) |

**Docstring / comments:** update module header in [`rl/encoder.py`](../../rl/encoder.py) (lines 1–48) to describe me/enemy; rename `_p0_income_share` to an observer-argument helper (e.g. `_income_share_for`) internally.

**`active_player` scalar (recommended):** use **`my_turn` binary** at index 9. **Do not** keep raw `state.active_player` in the vector — it breaks symmetry across seats (same as §7 risks). Engine `state.active_player` remains the source of truth in logs and `GameState`.

---

## 3. Game log schema implications

**Existing (engine) fields stay:** `winner ∈ {0,1}` = engine seat index; `p0_co` / `p1_co` (and `*_id`), `co_p0` / `co_p1` names, `property_count[0/1]`, `captures_*` by engine player, `opening_player`, etc.

**Add:**

- **`me` ∈ {0,1}** — engine seat the **learner** (trained policy) controlled for this episode.
- **`log_schema_version` bump** (e.g. 1.8 → 1.9) on the same write path as in [`rl/env.py`](../../rl/env.py) lines 1484–1491.

**Recommendation:** keep **all** existing fields in **engine-seat** semantics. **Do not** rewrite `winner` or CO columns to me/enemy — that would break [`analysis/co_ranker.py`](../../analysis/co_ranker.py), [`analysis/co_h2h.py`](../../analysis/co_h2h.py), and every notebook that already joins on `p0_co_id` / `winner`. Analysts use:

- `agent_won = (df["winner"] == df["me"])` when `me` is present;
- `agent_won = (df["winner"] == 0)` for legacy rows where the agent was always P0.

**Rationale:** engine seat is the stable key into `GameState` and the replay format; `me` is a single integer overlay for “who was learning/acting” without aliasing away `winner` meaning.

**Deprecate / clarify** `agent_plays` (today hardcoded `0` at line 1442): replace with `me` or set `agent_plays = me` for backward-friendly dashboards.

---

## 4. BC training data implications (MASTERPLAN §9)

**Row shape for ego-centric + both seats (same map):**

- **`me` ∈ {0,1}** for each row (human or learner seat for that decision).
- **`spatial` / `scalars`:** from `encode_state(state_before_action, observer=me, belief=…)` (STD: `belief=None` in offline; fog off-bundle).
- **`action_idx` / `action_mask`:** from the engine’s legal set for that **turn**; flat index is unchanged, but the **mask** is for `state.active_player == me` on that row.
- **P0 row (`me=0`):** same tuple family as today’s human_demos, but scalars/ spatial use me/enemy with observer 0.
- **P1 row (`me=1`):** same, with observer 1; **me** units sit in 0:14.

**Train on both rows of the same game?** **Yes** for BC (no on-policy issue). **Correlation caveat:** not independent; MASTERPLAN §9 recommends seat alternation across **independent** episodes for **actor** batches — for BC, document oversampling or batch construction if needed.

**One-line spec for [`scripts/train_bc.py`](../../scripts/train_bc.py):**  
Each JSONL row **must** include integer **`me`**, and the stored **`spatial`/`scalars`** must match **`encode_state(..., observer=me)`**; rows missing `me` default to `0` for legacy human_demos, or the script re-encodes from a replay with explicit seat.

**Ingestion:** update [`tools/human_demo_rows.py`](../../tools/human_demo_rows.py) filter from “only P0” to “both seats” when the trace supports it; [`server/play_human.py`](../../server/play_human.py) continues to log **only human seat 0** unless the UI is extended.

---

## 5. Test plan (proposed)

1. **Swap / asymmetry (channel ordering):** build a state with at least one **P0** unit and no P1 (or a known pattern). Assert `encode_state(..., observer=0)[spatial unit me block]` has signal in **0:14**; `encode_state(..., observer=1)` has that unit’s presence in **14:28** (enemy block).
2. **Mirror / paired states (invariance):** *Not* `encode(s)==encode(s')` for arbitrary “swap” without care — only holds if you **construct** `s_b` as `s_a` with P0↔P1 *and* you compare `encode_state(s_a, observer=0)` to `encode_state(s_b, observer=1)` with symmetric maps/COs. Document: **invariance test** = equality under that **full board swap** + same `luck_seed` / mirror symmetry; otherwise assert **expected permutation** of channels, not byte equality of unrelated states.
3. **Scalar 9 (my turn):** for fixed `state`, `scalars[9] == 1.0` iff `state.active_player == observer`.
4. **Scalar 16 (me income share):** spot-check against `state.count_income_properties(observer) / n_income` on a few boards.
5. **HP (STD, belief off):** unchanged numeric HP in lo/hi for all units; optional parity with pre-ego for `belief is None` paths.
6. **Regression:** [`tests/test_encoder_equivalence.py`](../../tests/test_encoder_equivalence.py) + [`tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz`](../../tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz) are the **restart gate** for any future encoder change; regen only as in [`tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_README.md`](../../tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_README.md) (see §7).

---

## 6. Migration ordering (implementing composer)

1. **Encoder** + unit tests (§5) + docstrings in [`rl/encoder.py`](../../rl/encoder.py) — **landed** (70ch ego-centric; see Implementation status).
2. **Encoder equivalence** harness: `encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz` is the **current** frozen tensor contract (name is historical); replace/regenerate only on intentional encoder edits per [`tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_README.md`](../../tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_README.md). Old **policy** zips are invalid across channel/restart boundaries regardless of filename.
3. **`AWBWEnv`:** learner seat + ` _get_obs(observer=learner)` + opponent loop / reward / Φ in learner frame (large change — may land in the same diff as seat-balanced-actor or immediately after).
4. **`log_schema_version` + `me` field** in [`rl/env.py`](../../rl/env.py) `_log_finished_game`.
5. **Tooling & demos:** `play_human`, `human_demo_rows`, `verify_observation_encoding`, `phi_smoke` / eval scripts as needed.
6. **BC** [`scripts/train_bc.py`](../../scripts/train_bc.py) + demo JSONL contract.
7. **Analysis docs** (MASTERPLAN / seat_measurement / player_seats) for `agent_won` with `me`.

Encoder-only PR without env seat plumbing produces **policy training inconsistency** (P0 step still, P0-ego obs) unless the env immediately passes `observer=0` (no visible change) — the **value** of ego is unlocked when `observer` follows the **learner**.

---

## 7. Risks / unknowns

- **Reward / Φ / terminal return** are **P0-learner-shaped** today ([`rl/env.py`](../../rl/env.py) P1 reward negation, `_compute_phi` in P0 frame). Ego **encoding** alone does not fix credit assignment; **seat-balanced** training needs an explicit spec for return signs and whether the critic uses raw `V` or flipped on opponent seat (MASTERPLAN §9).
- **Opponent as P1** is wired throughout (`_run_policy_opponent`, wall timers `wall_p0_s` / `wall_p1_s` naming). Generalizing to “learner may be P1” touches **more** than [`rl/encoder.py`](../../rl/encoder.py).
- **`play_human` bot** path ([`server/play_human.py`](../../server/play_human.py) line 314) uses `encode_state(state)` without `observer=1` — with ego fix, the bot should use `observer` = bot seat.
- **MCTS** ([`rl/mcts.py`](../../rl/mcts.py)) already uses `active_player` as observer; ego makes the **spatial** view match “I am the mover” in me/enemy form — **valuable** but changes tensor bytes vs any saved MCTS snapshot tests.
- **BC rows** in the wild: old rows are P0-ego (`observer=0` after refactor) or P0-fixed-blocks (before refactor). Re-ingest or version **`encoder_version`** / schema in each demo row.
- **Encoder equivalence harness** ([`tests/test_encoder_equivalence.py`](../../tests/test_encoder_equivalence.py)): fails when `encode_state` **output** drifts from [`tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz`](../../tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz) — **expected** after any intentional encoder change; treat as the **restart gate** (regen policy: [`tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_README.md`](../../tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_README.md)).

**STD / fog:** this map does not extend belief POMDP; HP remains as today for STD.

## Verification checklist (this spec)

- **Line numbers** were checked against `Read` / `Grep` of the files above; implementers should re-run before merge.
- **Scalar count** remains **17** — **no** `N_SCALARS` bump, only **semantic** remapping of indices 0–7, 9–11, 16; **8, 12–15** unchanged (turn, tier, weather).
- **Harness:** [`tests/test_encoder_equivalence.py`](../../tests/test_encoder_equivalence.py) pins **70**-channel ego-centric output to [`tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz`](../../tests/fixtures/encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz); a **new** frozen baseline (per README) is required when the tensor contract changes again, invalidating tied checkpoints.

## Report-back summary (for parent agent)

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Doc path** | [`docs/restart_arch/ego_centric_refactor_map.md`](ego_centric_refactor_map.md) (this file) |
| **Refactor table** | **~33** site rows (multi-line ranges grouped) |
| **Non-obvious / high impact** | (1) [`rl/mcts.py`](../../rl/mcts.py) already passes `active_player` as `observer` — ego aligns tensor with mover; (2) [`server/play_human.py`](../../server/play_human.py) bot used default `encode_state` (P0 view) while acting as P1; (3) full **seat-balance** needs env reward/opponent generalization, not encoder alone; (4) **Φ / level** shaping is P0-framed; (5) [`tools/human_demo_rows.py`](../../tools/human_demo_rows.py) filters P0-only today — BC both-seats needs filter + `me`. |
| **Biggest risk** | **Env** (`step`, P1 auto-loop, return sign, `_compute_phi`) — larger than `rl/encoder.py` in lines of effect. |
| **Encoder equivalence** | **Active** — `encoder_equivalence_pre_restart.npz` + README; any tensor change should fail tests until a reviewed regen. |

*This document includes 2026-04 implementation status for the encoder tensor; remaining rows cover env / logging / BC follow-ups. No Python changes in the doc-only edit that added that status.*
